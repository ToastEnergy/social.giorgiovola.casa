self-hosted social network

## running with Docker

```
docker compose up -d
```

That's it: the database is created and migrated automatically on every start. The app listens on port `7777` at http://localhost:7777 (only on localhost by default, see `BIND_ADDRESS`). Set `SIGNUP_PASSWORD` to allow registrations.

To customize settings, copy `.env.example` to `.env` (docker compose picks it up automatically) and edit it:

Data lives in the `postgres-data`, `avatars` and `uploads` docker volumes (`uploads` holds the images attached to posts: up to 5 per post, 10MB each; PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, AVIF, BMP, ICO and SVG, all re-encoded to WebP and scaled down to 2048px; avatars become 512px WebP squares). You should put the app behind a reverse proxy like [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/caddyfile) or [nginx](https://gist.github.com/journeymanavi/dc7df599dd7618a12528c553ea47b1b1) to add at least https and gzip compression.

## backups

`scripts/backup.sh` backs up a docker deployment with [restic](https://restic.net) (0.17 or newer): a dump of the database (snapshot tagged `db`) and the `avatars` and `uploads` volumes, plus `dm-uploads` when the deployment has it (tagged `files`), then it drops old snapshots (7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly by default) and reads back a small sample of the repository to catch damage early. The repository is created on the first run. Run it as root on the server, from the directory the app runs from:

```
cp scripts/backup.env.example /etc/social-backup.env   # set RESTIC_REPOSITORY and the password file
chmod 600 /etc/social-backup.env
openssl rand -base64 32 > /etc/social-backup.password && chmod 600 /etc/social-backup.password
scripts/backup.sh
```

Keep a copy of the password somewhere other than the server: without it the backups can't be read. To run it every night, add a line to root's crontab (`crontab -e`):

```
30 3 * * * /opt/social/scripts/backup.sh >> /var/log/social-backup.log 2>&1
```

Set `HEALTHCHECK_URL` to get an alert from a service like [healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io) when a backup fails or stops running.

`scripts/restore.sh` puts a backup back, replacing the current database, avatars and uploads (it asks first, and stops the app while restoring). By default it takes the latest snapshots; pass the ids from `restic snapshots` to pick older ones: `scripts/restore.sh <db snapshot> <files snapshot>`. On a new server, clone the repository, copy `.env` and `/etc/social-backup.env`, run `docker compose up -d` once to create the volumes, then `scripts/restore.sh`. Pending migrations are applied when the app starts again.

### backing up the bucket

When the assets live in an S3 / R2 bucket, set `S3_BUCKET` in `/etc/social-backup.env` too. The backup then copies the bucket into a local mirror (`MIRROR_DIR`, `/var/lib/social-backup/assets` by default, readable by root only) with [rclone](https://rclone.org), and backs up the mirror instead of the volumes, still tagged `files`. restic keeps the versions, encrypts them and applies the retention, so deleted and overwritten objects can be restored for as long as their snapshots are kept. If the copy fails, the backup stops and reports the failure without taking a snapshot of a half-copied mirror.

1. Install rclone on the server (`apt install rclone`, or see [its install page](https://rclone.org/install/)).
2. In the Cloudflare dashboard, R2 → _Manage API tokens_ → _Create API token_: permission **Object Read only**, applied to that one bucket. Read only means that someone who gets into the backup host can't change or delete the assets.
3. Put the token in `/etc/social-backup.env` as an rclone remote, through environment variables (no `rclone.conf` needed; the commented example in `scripts/backup.env.example` has all of them): `S3_BUCKET`, `RCLONE_CONFIG_R2_TYPE=s3`, `RCLONE_CONFIG_R2_PROVIDER=Cloudflare`, `RCLONE_CONFIG_R2_ENDPOINT`, `RCLONE_CONFIG_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `RCLONE_CONFIG_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
4. Run `scripts/backup.sh` and check that `restic ls latest --tag files` lists the bucket's `uploads/`, `avatars/` and `dm/` objects.

`scripts/restore.sh` then puts the files snapshot back into the bucket with `rclone sync`, which also deletes the objects that aren't in the snapshot. The read-only token can't do that, so it asks for the key pair of a token with **Object Read & Write** on the bucket (the app's token works), or takes it from `RESTORE_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `RESTORE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. Don't keep that token in the backup config. Pass a files snapshot taken in bucket mode: older snapshots of the volumes go back into the volumes, with `S3_BUCKET` unset.

**Privacy:** message images that were deleted (with their message, or with a deleted profile) stay in the backups until the retention drops every snapshot that holds them: up to 12 months with the default `KEEP_MONTHLY=12`. Lower `KEEP_MONTHLY` (and `KEEP_WEEKLY` / `KEEP_DAILY`) to keep them for less time. The same goes for the volumes, and for deleted posts in the database dumps.

## regiorgios

The arrows button under a post opens a menu with two ways to reshare it:

- **Regiorgio** reshares it as is: it shows up on your profile and in your followers' _Following_ feed, marked "… regiorged" (or "… and 2 others regiorged" when more of the profiles in that feed did), as of when it was last regiorged. Open the menu again to undo it.
- **Quote** writes a new post (text and up to 5 images) with the post embedded under it. A quote is a normal post: it shows up wherever your posts do and can be liked, replied to and regiorged itself. If the quoted post is deleted, the quote stays and says so.

The count next to the arrows is regiorgios plus quotes; click it to see who regiorged and who quoted. The author gets a notification for both (a quote that also @mentions them notifies once, as a quote). Muted users can't regiorgio or quote (they can still undo their regiorgios).

## polls

The bars button in the composer adds a poll to a post (or a reply, or a quote): 2 to 4 options of up to 80 characters, open for 1 hour to 7 days. The post's text is the question. Every profile gets one vote, which can be changed until the poll ends; the results show once you have voted or the poll has ended, and update live. Polls can't be edited, only deleted with their post.

## group chats

_New group_ on the messages page starts a group chat with a name and the people you pick, up to 32 members. Groups show up in the conversation list next to direct messages, with the same unread badges, live updates and push notifications. Messages can have text and up to 5 images, and only their sender can delete them.

The group's info page (the group name at the top of the chat) lists its members. Anyone in the group can rename it and add people (newcomers see the history, but none of it is unread for them), and anyone can leave. Only the owner, its creator, can remove others; when the owner leaves, the longest standing member takes over, and when the last member leaves the group is deleted with its messages. You can't add someone you blocked or who blocked you. Bots can be added like anyone else: they read and write in the group through the bot API, and can leave it, but can't create groups or add, remove or rename. Muted users can't create, rename or write in groups.

Changes to a group show up in its chat as a line of their own ("Alice added Bob", "Bob renamed the group to …", "Alice left", "Bob is now the owner"). They never count as unread and send no push.

## replies, reactions and mentions in chats

In direct and group chats, swipe a message to the right to reply to it (like WhatsApp), or use the reply button that shows next to it on hover. The reply quotes the message it answers; tapping the quote jumps to it. Long press a message (or the smiley button on hover) for its menu: six quick reactions, reply, copy and delete. A double tap adds a ❤️. Everyone has one reaction per message, picking another replaces it and picking the same one again takes it back (or tap your own in the reactions list). Tapping the reactions under a message lists who reacted with what. Reactions update live and send no push. A reaction to your message marks the chat unread (it counts in the messages badge, and the chat shows the emoji, or a dot, instead of a number) until you open it, but the chat still opens where your unread messages begin, not at the message that got the reaction. The latest reaction you made, or one to your message, also moves the chat to the top of the list with a line like "Alice reacted ❤️ to …".

Typing `@` in a chat suggests people (the group's members in a group), and mentions link to the profile like in posts. In a group, a message that mentions you sends you a push even when you muted the group.

## typing and muting

In direct and group chats you see who is writing ("Alice is typing…", also in the conversation list). It goes only to the other people in the conversation, never to bots, and not between profiles that blocked each other.

_Mute_, at the top of a chat, silences that conversation for you only: no push notifications, and its unread messages stay out of the badge on the messages icon. In the conversation list a muted chat keeps its unread count, greyed out. _Unmute_ undoes it.

## accounts and identities

- **Switching accounts:** up to 5 accounts can be signed in on one browser. Use the avatar menu in the header to switch, and _Sign in to another account_ to add one.
- **Identities:** extra profiles that belong to an account and have no email or password (up to 10 per account). Create and delete them at `/accounts`. They post, like and get notifications on their own, and the owning account is never shown publicly. Deleting an identity also deletes its posts. An identity can be shared with up to 10 other accounts (_Share_ at `/accounts`): they can switch to it and use it like you do, and get its notifications on their devices, but only the owner can delete it or change who it is shared with. They can give it back with _Leave_.
- **Passkeys:** optional. Add them at `/settings` (avatar menu → _Settings_) to sign in with a fingerprint, face, screen lock or security key instead of the password, which keeps working either way. Passkeys belong to the account, not its identities, and are bound to the hostname of `PUBLIC_URL`, so changing the domain invalidates them.

## bots

Create bots at `/settings` → _OAuth_ (up to 5 per account), or with `POST /api/v1/me/bots`. A bot is a profile with a "bot" badge, driven only through the bot API (or the v1 API with its token): you can't switch to it, and it sends no push notifications to its owner. Its token is shown once when the bot is created. _New token_ replaces it and the old one stops working right away. Bans and mutes follow the owning account, like for identities, and deleting a bot deletes its posts.

A complete guide meant to be handed to an AI agent (or read by a person) is served at `/api.txt`, and the same API is documented for developers at `/developers`. Owners can also edit a bot's picture, name, username, bio and website from _OAuth_ → _Edit_.

Every request sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and gets JSON back. Errors come back as `{ "error": "…" }`. A bot can make 120 requests a minute, with lower limits on writes: 20 posts, 70 messages (direct and group), 60 message reactions, 60 likes, 30 poll votes, 30 regiorgios and 30 follows a minute, and 10 profile edits an hour.

`mentions` and `feed` return posts oldest first. `?limit=` is 1–100 (default 20). Without `?after=` you get the most recent ones. Pass the id of the last post you handled as `?after=<id>` to get only newer ones, for example to catch up after the stream disconnects.

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://example.com/api/bot/mentions?after=120
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"content":"hello!","reply_to":121}' https://example.com/api/bot/posts
curl -N -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://example.com/api/bot/stream
```

## API (v1)

Everything the web UI does is a documented JSON API under `/api/v1`, and the web UI is itself a client of it, so you can build a mobile app, a CLI or another front end on it. The full reference (bodies, responses, limits, errors, server-sent events and curl examples) is Part 1 of `/api.txt`; `/developers` lists the endpoints too.

- **Auth:** `POST /api/v1/auth/login` with `{ "username", "password" }` answers a bearer token (`sgu_…`, valid 90 days). Personal access tokens can be created in `/settings` → _Sessions and API tokens_ or with `POST /api/v1/auth/tokens`. Bot tokens (`sgc_…`) work too. Send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; the web UI uses its session cookie instead, which is ignored on requests from other origins. Only hashes of tokens are stored, and every session and token can be listed and revoked.
- **Identities:** a token acts as one profile at a time; `POST /api/v1/auth/switch` with `{ "username" }` moves it to the account or one of its identities.
- **Conventions:** JSON in and out, errors are `{ "error": "…" }`, lists are `{ "items": [...], "next_cursor": "…" | null }` with `?limit=` and `?cursor=`. Send `Content-Type: application/json` on every write, even without a body, and upload images as the raw request body: SvelteKit refuses body-less and form writes that don't come from the site. CORS is open (`*`, no credentials).
- **Compatibility:** v1 only changes additively; the original bot API under `/api/bot` (below) keeps working unchanged.

## moderation

There are three roles: users, mods and admins.

- **Mods** delete posts and replies, ban and mute users, and unban and unmute them from the panel at `/admin`. Banned users are signed out and can't sign in; muted users can't post, reply or send messages. Bans and mutes apply to the whole account, identities included: a muted owner's shared identities are muted for everyone using them, and a banned owner's ones stop working.
- **Admins** can do everything a mod can, and also reset passwords and make users mods (or remove them) from `/admin`.
- Staff only act on people ranked below them: mods on users, admins on users and mods. Nobody moderates themselves.

Admins are created from the command line, so there is always a way in:

```
bun admin.ts <username>             # make an account an admin
bun admin.ts <username> --revoke    # back to a regular user
docker compose exec web bun admin.ts <username>
```

## development

```
bun install
cp .env.example .env # set DATABASE_URL to a postgres instance
bun run db:migrate
bun run dev
```

## database

The schema lives in `src/lib/server/db/schema.ts` and is managed with [drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) migrations (the generated SQL is in `drizzle/`). Pending migrations are applied every time the container starts, or by hand with `bun run db:migrate`. Databases created before migrations were introduced are detected and picked up automatically.

To change the schema, edit `schema.ts`, then run `bun run db:generate` and commit the new files in `drizzle/`. For things drizzle can't model (triggers, functions, data fixes) use `bunx drizzle-kit generate --custom --name <name>` and write the SQL by hand, like `drizzle/0001_notification_triggers.sql`.
